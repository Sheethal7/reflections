When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  Remote repository facilitates collaborations.Remote repositories can be used when we prefer our work to be public.
  when we keep all our work local,the changes cannot be seen by anybody else.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If Git automatically updated with our local repository after every single commit, things may become public even before they are full ready.
  So, it is better if we manually pull changes when required.
